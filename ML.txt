 Types of ML algs:
------------------------
1. Supervised
2. Unsupervised
3. Reinforcement

1. Supervised :
 --------------------
1.1 classification
1.2 regression
1.3 ensembling

2. Unsupervised :
----------------------
1.1 clustering
1.2 association
1.3 dimensionality reduction

 Classification:  Used when output variable is in the form of categories
-------------------
 Regression: Used when output variable is in the form of real values
 ---------------
Ensemble: Used to combine various ML models which are individually weak
-------------
 Clustering: is used to group samples such that objects within the same cluster are 
-------------
 more similar to each other


 Dimentionality reduction: is used to reduce the number of variables of a dataset 
----------------------------------
while ensuring that important information is still conveyed. 
Done using Feature Extraction methods and Feature Selection methods.


 ML algs :
These for supervised models
1. Linear regression
2. Logistic reg
3. Decision trees
4. Naive bayes
5. KNN

These for unsupervised models
 1. K-means
2. Principal component analysis (PCA)

For ensemble there are some different algs....
Random forsets...
Adaboost

 For any ML proj :
1)import req libs
2)import the datasets
3)have a look at the rows, columns and content present in the dataset
4)check for null values.... If present then resolve those
5)perform data analysis and visualization tasks (EDA and all)..... Also check the correlation of different variables
6)perform feature eng and feature selection if required
7)Perform data cleaning operations... Depends on the dataset
 After this... Train tha data over your ML model.... Get the accuracy and try improving it
 These are steps for all ML projects....
